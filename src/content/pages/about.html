                    At Jim's RV Inspections Services, we believe every RV buyer,
                    seller, and owner deserves clear, honest information before
                    making important decisions. That’s why Jim, our owner and
                    lead inspector, brings his years of hands-on experience and
                    professional training to every inspection.

                    Based in <b>Portland, Oregon</b>, Jim is a
                    <b>certified NRVIA inspector</b> who has completed
                    <b>over 400 inspections</b> since earning his certification
                    in 2022. His expertise covers everything from essential
                    systems like propane and plumbing to detailed exterior
                    assessments, helping clients get a full picture of an RV’s
                    condition.

                    extra mile by including estimated repair costs, giving you
                    valuable context for negotiations, budgeting, or planning
                    your next steps. Whether you’re buying your dream RV,

                    Northwest. From the rainy climate’s effect on seals and
                    roofs to the wear and tear of cross-country travel, Jim
                    brings local knowledge and real-world experience to every
                    inspection.
