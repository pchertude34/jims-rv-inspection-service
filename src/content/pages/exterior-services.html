    This Stitch is used for content heavy interior pages
    that have no design or layout.  Often times these are 
    content silos where you talk extensively about a topic
    to educate your visitors and rank on Google for the 
    content.  These are great for pages that have a TON
    of content.  Design isn't important here, it's all 
    about making the content accessible and easy to read.

        <h1 class="cs-title">Our Inspection Services</h1>
        <p class="cs-text">At Jim's RV Inspection Services, we offer a range of inspection services designed to give RV buyers, 
          sellers, and owners the information they need to make smart, confident decisions. Whether you're purchasing your first 
          RV, preparing to sell, or filing a warranty or insurance claim, our certified inspections provide the clarity and 
          documentation you need.
        </p>

        <h3>Pre-Purchase RV Inspections</h3>
        <b class="cs-subtitle">Know Before You Buy</b>
        <p class="cs-text">Purchasing an RV is a big investment — don’t go into it blind. Our pre-purchase inspections give you a clear picture of the RV’s condition, from top to bottom, so you can avoid costly surprises and negotiate with confidence.</p>

        <h3>Seller Inspections</h3>
        <b class="cs-subtitle">Sell with Confidence</b>
        <p class="cs-text">Want to stand out from other sellers and speed up your sale? A seller inspection gives you the chance to address potential issues before listing and provides buyers with documented proof of your RV’s condition.</p>

        <h3>Warranty & Insurance Inspections</h3>
        <b class="cs-subtitle">Supporting Your Claims</b>
        <p class="cs-text">If your RV needs repairs covered under a manufacturer warranty or insurance policy, we’ll provide a detailed inspection and professional documentation to support your claim. Clear, thorough reports help streamline the claims process.</p>

        <h3>Essential Systems Inspections</h3>
        <b class="cs-subtitle">Focused System Checks</b>
        <p class="cs-text">Not every inspection needs to cover every inch of your RV. Our essential systems inspection focuses on critical components — propane, electrical, and plumbing — to ensure the most important systems are safe and functioning properly.</p>

        <h2>How the Inspection Process Works</h2>
        <h4>Step 1: Book Your Inspection</h4>
        <p class="cs-text">Contact us to schedule your inspection. We’ll ask for basic details about your RV, location, and the type of inspection you need.</p>

        <h4>Step 2: On-Site Inspection</h4>
        <p class="cs-text">Jim will meet you at the RV’s location — whether it’s at a dealership, storage lot, private sale, or your driveway. The inspection typically takes 3-5 hours, depending on the RV’s size and the type of service.</p>

        <h4>Step 3: Detailed Report Delivered</h4>
        <p class="cs-text">After the inspection, you’ll receive a comprehensive digital report, including photos, descriptions, and estimated repair costs (if needed). We’ll walk you through the findings so you fully understand the RV’s condition.</p>

        <h4>Step 4: Your Questions Answered</h4>
        <p class="cs-text">If you have follow-up questions after reviewing your report, Jim is available to answer them and help you decide on your next steps.</p>

        <h3>Proudly Service Portland, Oregon and Beyond</h3>
        <p class="cs-text">As a locally based inspector in Portland, Oregon, we serve RV owners across Oregon and Washington. No matter where your RV takes you, you deserve peace of mind knowing it’s safe, sound, and ready for the road.</p>
